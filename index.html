Welcome to my Website! this is a site that holds infomation about my programs that I have developed.
</p>
<p>
I am a 15 year old programmer, and have taught myself java, html/css, and a little bit of c++ (enough to be able to read and understand it). I love programming, and have been doing it since I was 13 years old. I mainly like to develop games, though I have only developed one so far.
</p>
<p>
If you have any suggestions as to software that you would like me to program, or if you would like to point out any bugs in the games, don't be afraid to reach out to me! All contact details can be found on the contact me page.
</p>

<p>
All infomation about game updates or download links can be found in the games page. the Downloads use Adf.ly links, so you will be required t oview an add for 5 seconds.

</p>
<p>Hope You enjoy my Hard Work!</p>
