This piece of software disables Education Queensland Blue coat proxy software(also known as the Blue coat unified agent), software that blocks access to certain sites. Please note, use this at your own risk. I am not responsible if you get in trouble for using this. I only made this as I wanted to go on reddit, which for some stupid reason the school issued computers did not allow me to access. Please only use responsibly!
